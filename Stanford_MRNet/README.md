# Deep learning in medical imaging: Detection of knee injuries in MRI Scans

The goal of this project is the implementation of the Stanford MRNet for knee injuries detection. <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002699">Link to the research paper</a>

# Dataset

The dataset can be downloaded at: <a href="https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/mrnet/"></a>.
It contains 1370 knee MRI exams performed at Stanford University Medical Center to study the presence of Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) tears.

# Model architecture
The inputs have the dimensions 3 × 256 × 256
